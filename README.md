## Answers
1. Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering methods and tools to develop and maintain software   systems. It enables creation of reliable, scalable and innovative software solutions.

2. 
* Development of Programming Languages like C.
In the 1970s, programming languages like C were created to provide developers with powerful tools to write more complex software efficiently. C laid the foundation for many modern programming languages (such as C++, C#, and Java) and introduced key concepts like structured data and modular programming.
 Establishment of Software Engineering as a Discipline (1960s)
The 1960s marked the formal establishment of software engineering as a distinct discipline. The term “software engineering” was popularized by the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference, which addressed the “software crisis”—the difficulty in delivering reliable, maintainable software on time and within budget. This milestone highlighted the need for systematic, engineering-based approaches to software development, emphasizing planning, documentation, testing, and quality control. It led to the development of software engineering principles, methodologies, and best practices aimed at improving software reliability and developer productivity.
* Advent of Structured Programming (1970s)
In the 1970s, structured programming emerged as a response to the complexity and error-prone nature of unstructured or "spaghetti" code. It promoted the use of clear control structures like loops and conditionals and avoided the use of "GOTO" statements, which could make code difficult to understand and debug. Structured programming improved readability, maintainability, and modularity of code, making it easier for teams to work collaboratively on large projects.
* Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s)
In the early 2000s, Agile methodologies gained popularity as an alternative to traditional, rigid software development models like the Waterfall method. Agile methodologies prioritize flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development, allowing for continuous adaptation to changing requirements. The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, introduced values and principles that shifted focus from comprehensive documentation and upfront planning to adaptive planning, rapid delivery, and frequent feedback. Agile transformed the industry by emphasizing a more collaborative and responsive approach to development, leading to frameworks like Scrum and Kanban, which remain widely used in modern software development.

3. 
* Requirements.
Search for what the system requires and what the user needs.
* Design
Create high leveled and detailed design of software architecture.
* Implementation.
Write code and build software according to design specification.
* Testing.
Conduct various tests to ensure software is at a good standard.
* Deployment.
Release the software to users or customers.
* Maintenance.
Provide support and updates to the software.
4.
waterfall methodology uses a sequential aproach with distinct phase while agile methodlogy uses an iterative aproach .waterfall is best for projects with concrete timelines and are well understood while agile was for projects where significant constraints are not well understood.
5. A software developer writes code and implements software solutions
   A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
   A project manager oversees planning ,execution and delivery of software applications

6. IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writting and testing codes whilw version control systems facilitates coordinating work among tea members and tracking changes to software code
7. a)requirements may change during development cycle leading to projects delays
   b)tight dealines can result in rushed development leading to compromised quality  
   C)technical debt accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions increases future in maintenance cost
   these challenges can be overcomed through efffective communication,regular reasssesment of project goals,tasks prioritization and use of agile methodologies

8. unit testing-testing individual modules of a system
   integration testing-testing interraction between different components
   system testing-testing the entire system as a whole
   acceptance testing-testing software against users requirements.
   All this helps identify and fix deffects early in software development process leading to higher quality software products.

   #quiz two
   1. prompt engineering is coming up with questions or statements to get best possible responses from AI models.prompt engineering helps avoid confusing  answers since it makes questions clear and specific.
   2. vague prompt:what are the importance of nails.
      improvement:what are the importance of construction nails.
      the improvement brings a more clear answer that satisfies the resarcher; instead of getting answers like nails are used for beauty,the answer will be construction nails are used for roofing and joining wood together.
